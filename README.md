# rateRNN_Mujoco

## To Do
- Make a toy model using 3 algorithms (Genetic Strategies, Deep Neuroevolution, Basic Random Seach)
- Try it on "InvertedPendulum-v4", and choose the best algorithm
- Use rateRNN for the policy network
- Make it on "InvertedPendulum-v4"
- Train it on "Hopper-v4" or "Ant-v4"  
- Evaluate the network and find some interesting patterns  
    - Heatmap for weights
    - Plot firing rate with time
    - Connectivity
